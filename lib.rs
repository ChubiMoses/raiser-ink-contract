/// The `Raiser` contract is a blockchain-based funding system implemented in Rust.
/// It allows users (contributors) to contribute funds to a pool and request payouts.
///
/// The contract maintains a record of the total supply of funds, the amount funded by each address,
/// and a list of contributors. It also keeps track of the minimum contribution amount, the owner of the contract,
/// and the maximum number of contributors allowed.
///
/// The contract emits events when a token transfer occurs and when an approval occurs that a spender is allowed to withdraw.
///
/// The contract has several key functions:
/// - `new` and `default`: Constructors for creating a new instance of the contract.
/// - `set_max_contributors`: Sets a new maximum number of contributors. Only the owner can call this function.
/// - `get_max_contributors`: Returns the maximum number of contributors.
/// - `contribute`: Allows a user to contribute funds to the pool.
/// - `get_contributors`: Returns a list of contributors and their respective balances.
/// - `request_token`: Allows a contributor to request a payout.
/// - `approve_request`: Allows the owner to approve a payout request.
/// - `get_next_requester`: Returns the AccountId of the next eligible requester.
/// - `get_completed_payouts`: Returns the number of completed payouts.
/// - `get_payout_history`: Returns the payout history.
/// - `next_contribution_cycle`: Initiates the next contribution cycle.
/// - `all_paid`: Checks if all contributors have been paid.
/// - `get_total_supply`: Returns the total token supply.
/// - `total_contributors`: Returns the total number of contributors.
/// - `balance_of`: Returns the balance of a specific account.
/// - `update_contract_fee`: Update the contract fee.
/// - `get_contract_fee`: Get the contract fee.
/// - `get_contract_earnings`: Get contract earnings.
/// The contract also defines several error types for handling common error scenarios.
///
/// The contract uses the ink! smart contract programming language, which is designed for writing secure and efficient blockchain contracts with Rust.

#[ink::contract]

/// The `Raiser` struct represents a blockchain-based funding system.
///
/// It contains several fields:
/// - `total_supply`: The total amount of funds in the system.
/// - `contributed`: A mapping from account IDs to a boolean indicating if they have contributed.
/// - `balance`: A vector of tuples, each containing an account ID and the balance of that account.
/// - `min_amount`: The minimum amount that can be contributed.
/// - `owner`: The account ID of the owner of the contract.
/// - `contributors`: A vector of account IDs of the contributors.
/// - `contributors_count`: The total number of contributors.
/// - `requests`: A vector of tuples, each containing an account ID and the amount they have requested.
/// - `completed_payouts`: The total number of completed payouts.
/// - `payout_history`: A vector of tuples, each containing an account ID and the amount they have been paid.
/// - `max_contributors`: The maximum number of contributors allowed.
/// - `contribution_cycle`: The current contribution cycle.
/// - `contract_fee`: The amount charged by the contract for every successful token request.
/// - `contract_earnings`: Amount earned from user transactions.
///
/// The struct is used to manage the state of the contract, including the total supply of funds, the contributors, and the payouts.
